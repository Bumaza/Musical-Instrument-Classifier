# A Simple Musical Instrument Classifier

The purpose of this work is to show and compare the difference kind of techniques to recognize a musical instrument from the single-note sounds.
  In proposed work, a Support Vector Machines, a Random Forest, k-nearest neighbors and Convolution Neural Networks are used for the musical instrument recognition accomplishment.
  The models are trained on fixed-length music with a labeled instrument.
  
## Dataset
The used dataset was collected from London Philharmonic Orchestra Dataset.
In total, over 5000 audio pieces of violin, viola, cello, double-bass, guitar, clarinet, and saxophone were collected.
